            <p>
                <p>Remember the days of boolean search operators? The frustrating experience of trying to find that one document by guessing the exact keywords it might contain? For decades, our ability to search through documents has been limited by keyword matching‚Äîa primitive approach that fails to capture the richness of human language and intent.</p>
<p>Traditional search technology has evolved through several stages: from basic keyword matching to more sophisticated approaches involving stemming, lemmatization, and eventually, statistical methods like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). Each iteration brought incremental improvements, but they all shared a fundamental limitation‚Äîthey didn&rsquo;t truly understand the meaning behind our queries.</p>

            <p>
                <p>Have you ever been stuck in a bank line where everyone needs to visit the same teller? Frustrating, right? Now imagine a bank where every customer could magically make their transaction without waiting for others to finish. Sounds like a dream? Well, that&rsquo;s exactly what lock-free and wait-free programming aims to achieve in the world of concurrent computing!</p>
<h2 id="the-concurrent-programming-challenge">The Concurrent Programming Challenge</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a simple scenario. Imagine you and your roommate share a kitchen (our computer&rsquo;s memory), and you&rsquo;re both trying to make sandwiches (execute operations) at the same time. In traditional programming, we&rsquo;d put a lock on the kitchen ‚Äì &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m using the kitchen, wait your turn!&rdquo; But what if your roommate just needs to grab a glass of water? Should they really have to wait for your entire sandwich-making process to finish?</p>

            <p>
                <p>Model Context Protocol (MCP) is rapidly transforming how we interact with computers by enabling natural language instructions to handle complex tasks. As we stand at the beginning of this revolution, we&rsquo;re witnessing fast-paced development in MCP tools and components.</p>
<p>While a detailed introduction to MCP was covered in our previous post, here&rsquo;s a quick refresher: MCP  servers expose various capabilities (like resources, tools, and prompts) to clients. The clients can then use these capabilities in conjunction with Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform tasks. The protocol standardizes how these components communicate, making it easy to build interoperable AI-powered applications.</p>

                <p>Imagine having a brilliant personal assistant who&rsquo;s incredibly smart but can only communicate through a mailbox - they can receive your letters and write back, but can&rsquo;t directly interact with your computer, check your calendar, or access your files. That&rsquo;s essentially the situation with today&rsquo;s Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude or GPT-4. Sure, they&rsquo;re incredibly capable, but they&rsquo;re often trapped behind an API, limited to text-in, text-out interactions.</p>

            <p>
                <p>Ever tried moving your entire apartment through a drinking straw? That&rsquo;s basically what building ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) systems feels like sometimes. You&rsquo;ve got terabytes of data that need to go from Point A to Point B, transform from one shape to another along the way, and arrive without losing a single byte. Oh, and it needs to happen yesterday.</p>
<p>As a backend engineer who&rsquo;s battled these challenges at scale, I&rsquo;ve learned that building reliable ETL systems is less about writing perfect code (though that helps) and more about preparing for everything that could possibly go wrong. Because trust me, Murphy&rsquo;s Law isn&rsquo;t just a suggestion when it comes to data pipelines ‚Äì it&rsquo;s more like a promise.</p>

Well, your legacy system is making those noises right now, and trust me ‚Äì it won&rsquo;t go away by itself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent the last 15 years listening to legacy systems whisper (and sometimes scream) their stories.

Nobody knew why Tuesdays ‚Äì the system had apparently developed a case of mid-week existential crisis. Turns out, it was trying to tell us something important: &ldquo;Your transaction log is full, and I&rsquo;ve been tap dancing on the edge of disaster for the past three months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Enter Go (or Golang, if you&rsquo;re feeling fancy). This language burst onto the scene in 2009 with a battle cry of &ldquo;concurrency made easy!&rdquo; And you know what?

<p>There was a time when applications allowed some kind of scripting to extend them and to make them fit into any workflow. For example VBScript for Microsoft office products.

Alas! they stopped it and Google search is less cool ever since. I would count regular expressions also as a mini-language.</p>

            <h2><a href="/terraform/ansible-cloud-setup/">Creating an isolated cluster - provisioning a cluster and a Bastion host using Ansible</a></h2>
            <p>
                <p>This is the second part of the series on setting up a cluster using Terraform and Ansible. In the <a href="../terraform-hetzner-cloud-setup-example/">first part</a>, we had set up the bare cluster Virtual Machines.
The set up included a virtual private network, a bastion server, and a separately configurable cluster of nodes.</p>
<p>The nodes are ready but not software or configuration is done so far. In the next step, we will provision all the nodes in our cloud</p>

            <p>
                <p>Infrastructure as code has a great benefit - you can make a cluster available in a few minutes. Then, switch the configuration with a few updates to the configuration. If you ever had long hours staring at blinking LEDs while it installed from a stack of CDs, you will know what a relief this is.</p>
<p>Terraform makes it possible to declaratively create the cloud infrastructure, supports all major cloud providers, and is easy to learn if you can spare an afternoon.</p>

            <h2><a href="/go/go-task-queue-with-badgerdb-backend/">Background task processor in Go with persistence support using BadgerDB</a></h2>
            <p>
                <p>Goroutines can run tasks concurrently. However, for most practical scenarios, you have to keep track of the status of those tasks. In case the process exited, killed, or power cycled, a mechanism should restart the unfinished tasks.
For example, imagine you moved order status emailing to a goroutine. If the process was terminated or restarted we have no way to keep track of the tasks that were in progress.
A background task manager can keep track of the task in progress, retry if required, and also manage scheduled and recurring tasks.
qUP (called queue up) is a background task manager. It persists the task status and tracking information to the disc so that restarting the process does not lose the tasks that were in progress. BadgerDB is used for persistence.</p>

            <h2><a href="/go/badgerdb-wrapper/">A Simple Wrapper to BadgerDB Key-Value store in Go</a></h2>
            <p>
                <p><a href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger">BadgerDB</a> is an embeddable key-value store written in Go. It is a persistent store.</p>
<p>In this article, we build a wrapper around badgerDB. The purpose of this wrapper is to make it simple to save simple values to the DB in &ldquo;virtual tables&rdquo;. The concept is an adaptation from the Sett project. Much of the code -especially the unit tests - are changed though.</p>

            <p>
                <p>Hugo is a fast static website builder written in Go language. The advantage of static sites is that the site can be hosted easily since it does not require any server-side scripting like PHP, Ruby, or a database like MySql.
Static sites are very fast since there is very little server-side processing involved. Most importantly, there are several platforms where you can host your website for Free! That&rsquo;s right, absolute 0 monthly costs.</p>
