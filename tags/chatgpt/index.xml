      <description>Imagine having a brilliant personal assistant who&amp;rsquo;s incredibly smart but can only communicate through a mailbox - they can receive your letters and write back, but can&amp;rsquo;t directly interact with your computer, check your calendar, or access your files. That&amp;rsquo;s essentially the situation with today&amp;rsquo;s Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude or GPT-4. Sure, they&amp;rsquo;re incredibly capable, but they&amp;rsquo;re often trapped behind an API, limited to text-in, text-out interactions.

      <description>LLMs are like enormous digital brains that have read a vast amount of text from the internetâ€”books, articles, websites, and more. By doing so, they learn how to predict what word comes next in a sentence, which in turn helps them write essays, summarize texts, and even create poetry. However, despite their impressiveness in handling language, these models often struggled with tasks that required deeper levels of reasoning or problem-solving, such as math.</description>
