      <description>&lt;p&gt;You know that uneasy feeling when your car makes a noise it&amp;rsquo;s definitely not supposed to make? That moment when you turn down the radio, tilt your head, and think, &amp;ldquo;Maybe if I ignore it, it&amp;rsquo;ll go away&amp;rdquo;? Well, your legacy system is making those noises right now, and trust me – it won&amp;rsquo;t go away by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last 15 years listening to legacy systems whisper (and sometimes scream) their stories. Like that time at a  startup when their core transaction system started hiccuping every Tuesday at 3 PM. Nobody knew why Tuesdays – the system had apparently developed a case of mid-week existential crisis. Turns out, it was trying to tell us something important: &amp;ldquo;Your transaction log is full, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been tap dancing on the edge of disaster for the past three months.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
