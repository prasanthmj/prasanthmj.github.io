            <p>
                Ever tried moving your entire apartment through a drinking straw? That&rsquo;s basically what building ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) systems feels like sometimes. You&rsquo;ve got terabytes of data that need to go from Point A to Point B, transform from one shape to another along the way, and arrive without losing a single byte. Oh, and it needs to happen yesterday.
As a backend engineer who&rsquo;s battled these challenges at scale, I&rsquo;ve learned that building reliable ETL systems is less about writing perfect code (though that helps) and more about preparing for everything that could possibly go wrong.

            <p>
                You know that uneasy feeling when your car makes a noise it&rsquo;s definitely not supposed to make? That moment when you turn down the radio, tilt your head, and think, &ldquo;Maybe if I ignore it, it&rsquo;ll go away&rdquo;? Well, your legacy system is making those noises right now, and trust me ‚Äì it won&rsquo;t go away by itself.
I&rsquo;ve spent the last 15 years listening to legacy systems whisper (and sometimes scream) their stories.

            <p>
                Picture this: You&rsquo;re standing in line at your favorite coffee shop. You order a complex drink (let&rsquo;s call it the &ldquo;Distributed Mocha Supreme&rdquo;), and the barista starts a carefully choreographed dance between the espresso machine, milk steamer, and various syrup stations. Everything&rsquo;s going great until‚Äîoops!‚Äîthey&rsquo;re out of whipped cream. Now what? Do they throw away everything they&rsquo;ve made so far? Ask you to pay for a half-finished drink? Call over three managers for approval?
