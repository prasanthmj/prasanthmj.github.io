      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever tried moving your entire apartment through a drinking straw? That&amp;rsquo;s basically what building ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) systems feels like sometimes. You&amp;rsquo;ve got terabytes of data that need to go from Point A to Point B, transform from one shape to another along the way, and arrive without losing a single byte. Oh, and it needs to happen yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a backend engineer who&amp;rsquo;s battled these challenges at scale, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that building reliable ETL systems is less about writing perfect code (though that helps) and more about preparing for everything that could possibly go wrong. Because trust me, Murphy&amp;rsquo;s Law isn&amp;rsquo;t just a suggestion when it comes to data pipelines ‚Äì it&amp;rsquo;s more like a promise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Your Legacy System is Trying to Tell You Something (And It&#39;s Not &#39;Please Reboot&#39;)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You know that uneasy feeling when your car makes a noise it&amp;rsquo;s definitely not supposed to make? That moment when you turn down the radio, tilt your head, and think, &amp;ldquo;Maybe if I ignore it, it&amp;rsquo;ll go away&amp;rdquo;? Well, your legacy system is making those noises right now, and trust me ‚Äì it won&amp;rsquo;t go away by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last 15 years listening to legacy systems whisper (and sometimes scream) their stories. Like that time at a  startup when their core transaction system started hiccuping every Tuesday at 3 PM. Nobody knew why Tuesdays ‚Äì the system had apparently developed a case of mid-week existential crisis. Turns out, it was trying to tell us something important: &amp;ldquo;Your transaction log is full, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been tap dancing on the edge of disaster for the past three months.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../images/coffee-spill-barista.webp&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Picture this: You&amp;rsquo;re standing in line at your favorite coffee shop. You order a complex drink (let&amp;rsquo;s call it the &amp;ldquo;Distributed Mocha Supreme&amp;rdquo;), and the barista starts a carefully choreographed dance between the espresso machine, milk steamer, and various syrup stations. Everything&amp;rsquo;s going great until‚Äîoops!‚Äîthey&amp;rsquo;re out of whipped cream. Now what? Do they throw away everything they&amp;rsquo;ve made so far? Ask you to pay for a half-finished drink? Call over three managers for approval? Welcome to the world of distributed transactions in microservices!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
