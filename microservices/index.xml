      <description>You know that uneasy feeling when your car makes a noise it&amp;rsquo;s definitely not supposed to make? That moment when you turn down the radio, tilt your head, and think, &amp;ldquo;Maybe if I ignore it, it&amp;rsquo;ll go away&amp;rdquo;?

You order a complex drink (let&amp;rsquo;s call it the &amp;ldquo;Distributed Mocha Supreme&amp;rdquo;), and the barista starts a carefully choreographed dance between the espresso machine, milk steamer, and various syrup stations. Everything&amp;rsquo;s going great until—oops!—they&amp;rsquo;re out of whipped cream. Now what? Do they throw away everything they&amp;rsquo;ve made so far? Ask you to pay for a half-finished drink? Call over three managers for approval?</description>
